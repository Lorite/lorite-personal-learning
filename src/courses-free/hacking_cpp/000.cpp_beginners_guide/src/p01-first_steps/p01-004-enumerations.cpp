/* Notes:
- Check the previous source files for notes on things not mentioned here.
- Warning: It is better to use scoped enumerations. They are safer and more
expressive.
- It is possible to change the underlying type of a scoped enumeration. And
the mapping of the enumerators can be customized.
- It is not easy to print the actual values (int text format) of scoped
enumerations. We would need to use a map or a switch statement or maybe a macro.
