"""
This module shows how to use if blocks, if-else blocks and if-elif-else
blocks to decide which lines of code to run (and skip).

    # The `else` statement also runs once all other `if` and `elif` conditions
    # fail. Notice that multiple lines get skipped, and that all the
    # conditions could have been compressed to `x_add_two != 3` for
    # simplicity. In this case, less logic results in more clarity

    # Python is one of the few programming languages that allows chained
    # comparisons. This is useful for checking if a variable is within
    # a range of values. You can see that in this example, the expression
    # `0 < x_add_two < 2` is equivalent to  `x_add_two > 0 and x_add_two < 2`
