Decorators add new functionality to a function or class at runtime.
This module shows how a simple "encryption" function for one string can
be decorated to work with a collection of strings. Note that the decorator
handles nested collections with the use of recursion.

    """Run a string function with a string or a collection of strings.

    We define a custom decorator that allows us to convert a function whose
    input is a single string into a function whose input can be a string
    or a collection of strings.

    A function decorator consists of the following:

    - An input function to run with
    - A wrapper function that uses the input function

    The `wrapper` does not need to accept the input function as a parameter
    because it can get that from its parent `run_with_any`. Also, the
    parameters that `wrapper` receives do NOT have to be the same as the
    ones that the input function `fn` needs to receive. However, it is highly
    recommended to have the parameter lists for `wrapper` and `fn` line up so
    that developers are less likely to get confused.

    The formal specification for function decorators is here:

    https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/

    The formal specification for class decorators is here:

        an example of the Strategy design pattern.

        But instead of writing the logic using classes, we write the logic
        using a single function that encapsulates all possible rules.
