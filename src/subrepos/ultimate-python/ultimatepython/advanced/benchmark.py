"""
As programs increase in size, they have the risk of getting slow as new
features are added and extra layers of complexity to the main features.
Benchmarking is an approach that helps developers use profiling metrics
and their code intuition to optimize programs further. This module uses
cProfile to compare the performance of two functions with each other.
