Inheritance is a way to reuse code and data from a parent class. This
allows us to avoid repeating ourselves and to build upon existing
functionality. This module defines a basic vehicle class, creates a car
class that inherits from vehicle, then creates a truck class that
inherits from car and use it for demonstration purposes.
